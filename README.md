### Movie Web Page BackEnd

- A BackEnd part of movie web page project a freeCodeCamp project.
- The BackEnd part saves users reviews from the  [FrontEnd part](https://github.com/nikaloamashvili/Movie-Web-Page-FrontEnd "FrontEnd part") in to Database (MongoDB) and using 'get' sends to FrontEnd part all reviews of movies.
- I used for this project my  scills in JavaScript and Node.js.
